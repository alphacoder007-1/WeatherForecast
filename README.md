The app will access information based user geolocation, and provide local weather information for the coming week. The user should be able to search for a different location, and get weather information from there. 

The app must save user search history, and offer it as “recently searched places.” 
Use unit tests, and integration tests, where applicable. 
Use the geolocator of your choice. 
For extra points consider adding a list of local points of interest.
